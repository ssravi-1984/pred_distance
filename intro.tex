\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\noindent
\textbf{Motivation.}~ 
Informally speaking,
the main question addressed in this paper is whether two configurations
that are similar evolved along similar trajectories.
To formulate a more concrete version of this question, we consider
two similar configurations, say \calcone{} and \calctwo, and
investigate questions regarding the similarity of their predecessor
configurations.

\noindent
\textbf{Summary of Results.}~ We present both theoretical and
experimental results.
Our theoretical results show that SyDSs may exhibit
extreme behaviors with respect to the evolution of configurations.
One of our results shows that there are SyDSs in which
for any two configurations \calcone{} and \calctwo{} 
which differ in $h$ bits, there are respective predecessors 
$\calcone'$ and $\calctwo'$ which also differ in exactly $h$ bits.
On the other hand, we also present examples of SyDSs in which
highly dissimilar configurations (i.e., configurations that differ
in all the $n$ bits) have predecessors that are very similar (i.e., they
differ in just one bit).
Likewise, we construct examples of SyDSs where two very similar 
configurations have highly dissimilar predecessors.
These examples point out that SyDSs may exhibit high sensitivity
with respect to initial conditions (i.e., starting configurations).
We also consider the problem of computing similarity
measures of predecessors of given configurations and show that
the problem is, in general, computationally intractable.

Our experimental results are based on using public domain Satisfiability
(SAT) solvers \cite{sat-live}.
We illustrate how the problem of computing predecessors of a
configuration can be expressed as an instance of the SAT
problem \cite{GJ-1979}.
Our experiments consider restricted classes of graphs and local functions.

\textbf{Related Work.}~
Computational problems associated with 
discrete dynamical systems 
have been addressed by many researchers.
For example, Barrett et al. \cite{BH+06} studied the
reachability problem under the sequential
update model, where a permutation of the vertices is also given,
and state updates are carried out in the order specified by the
permutation.  
%% They established computational intractability results
%% for the general case and obtained polynomial time algorithms when
%% local transition functions are limited to certain Boolean functions.
Bounds on the lengths of transients and cycles in restricted versions
of dynamical systems under the sequential update model are established
in \cite{MR-2007}.  
%% Wooldridge \cite{Woo-2002} presents a discussion
%% of complexity results for multi-agent systems.  
Tosic \cite{Tos-2010,Tosic-2017} presented results for fixed point enumeration
problems for systems with special forms of local transition
functions.  Kosub and Homan \cite{KH-2007} presented dichotomy
results that delineate computationally intractable and efficiently
solvable versions of counting fixed points, based on the class of
allowable local transition functions.  
Reference \cite{BH+07} considered the complexity
of the predecessor existence problem for various classes
of underlying graphs and local functions.
A more general version of the predecessor existence problem,
where the goal is to find $t$-predecessors for values of $t \geq 2$
has been studied in \cite{Kawachi-et-al-2017,MR+2018}.
%% for various restricted graph structures (e.g., grid graphs) and for
%% various restricted families of local transition functions
%(e.g., $k$-threshold functions for any $k \geq 2$).
Problems similar to predecessor existence have
also been considered in the context of cellular automata
\cite{Gre-1987,Dur-1994}.
