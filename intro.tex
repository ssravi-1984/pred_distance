\textbf{Research Questions and Summary of Results.} Informally speaking,
the main question addressed in this paper is whether two configurations
that are similar evolved along similar trajectories.
To formulate a more concrete version of this question, we consider
two similar configurations, say \calcone{} and \calctwo, and
investigate questions regarding the similarity of their predecessor
configurations.
