\section{Analytical Results}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, we present several analytical results regarding the
similarities of predecessor sets of two configurations of a SyDS.
The first result shows that there are SyDSs such that 
if a pair of distinct configurations is $h$-close, then 
any pair of their predecessors is also $h$-close.
Recall that for any configuration \calc, 


\begin{proposition}\label{pro:close-positive}
For integers $n$ and $h$, where $n \geq 1$ and $1 \leq h \leq n$,
there is a SyDS \cals{} with $n$
nodes with the following property: for any pair of  $h$, $1 \leq h \leq n$
\end{proposition}
