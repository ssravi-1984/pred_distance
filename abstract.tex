\textbf{Abstract}~~
We consider the time evolution of graph dynamical systems 
where each node has a state from \{0,1\}.
The configuration of a system at any time instant 
is a vector which specifies the state of each node at that instant. 
We say that two configurations are `similar' 
if the Hamming distance between them is small. 
We study questions related to the similarity of one-step
predecessors of two configurations that are similar.
We present examples to show that, 
in general, configurations that are similar may
have one-step predecessors that are highly dissimilar.
We observe that determining the level of similarity of 
predecessors of two configurations is computationally intractable.
We also study the similarity notion experimentally for several classes
of networks and local functions.
These experiments demonstrate the usefulness
of public domain Satisfiability solvers in analyzing 
graph dynamical systems.
